Linux is a free open source operating system that you can make changes to and redistribute. It is easy for understanding the working of a typical operating system. In this series we shall first look at the directory structure.


### Linux Terminal

The terminal is a program that recieves command from the user and gives it to the OS to process, and it shows the output. It is similar to `command prompt` in Windows. Majority of the tasks undertaken on Linux are through its terminal window.
Shortcut to open a terminal window is: Ctrl+Alt+T


### Understanding the Structure

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard [(FHS)](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html) defines the structure of file systems on Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems. We shall be looking at the directory structure of Ubuntu 16.04. (I have personalised my version a bit, hence the different appearance.)

![root.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/root.png "root.png")

Before diving into the directory structure, we first understand how Linux understands the files. The FHS classifies files into *shareable/unshareable* and *variable/static*.

**Shareable** files are those that can be stored on one host and used on others.

**Unshareable** files are not sharable.
eg. files in user home directories are shareabale whereas device lock files are not.
*Shareable* and *unshareable* files are segregated because sharing files makes it convenient to use necessary files which are installed on a foreign host by mounting the necessary directories.

**Static** files include binaries, libraries, docuumentation files and other files that do not change without system admin permissions.

**Variable** files are files that are not static.
*Static* and *variable* files are segregated becuase static files can be stored on read-only media and do not need to be backed up on the same schedule as  variable files.


An example of a FHS-compliant system:
<div class="row">
    <div class="large-12 columns">
        <table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th width="150">Shareable</th>
      <th width="150">Unshareable</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>static</td>
      <td>/usr</td>
      <td>/etc</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>/opt</td>
      <td>/boot</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>variable</td>
      <td>/var/mail</td>
      <td>/var/run</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>/var/spool/news</td>
      <td>/var/lock</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
    </div>
</div>


### The Filesystem



![fhs.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/fhs.png)



#### / : the root Directory:

This is similar to the `C:\` directory on Windows in function. The contents of this directory must be sufficient to boot, restore, recover and/or repair the system.

The following directories are required in `/ ` as per FHS.
<div class="row">
    <div class="large-12 columns">
        <table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Directory</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>bin</td>
      <td>Essential command binaries</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>boot</td>
      <td>Static files of the bootloader</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dev</td>
      <td>Device files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>etc</td>
      <td>Host specific system configuration</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>lib</td>
      <td>Essenyial shared libraries and kernel modules</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>media</td>
      <td>Mount point for removable media</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>mnt</td>
      <td>Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>opt</td>
      <td>Add-on application software packages</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>sbin</td>
      <td>Essential system binaries</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>srv</td>
      <td>Data for services provided by this system</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>tmp</td>
      <td>Temporary files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>usr</td>
      <td>Secondary hierarchy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>var</td>
      <td>Variable data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>home</td>
      <td>User home directories (optional)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>lib</td>
      <td>Alternate format essential shared libraries (optional)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>root</td>
      <td>Home directory for the root user (optional)</td>
    </tr>    

  </tbody>
</table>
    </div>
</div>


Every single file and directory has a path beginning from root directory i.e. path of folder bin is `/bin`. Only the root user has the privilege to modify files in this directory i.e. use `sudo`.



#### 1. /bin : essential user binaries:

It contains all the programs(binaries) that must be present when the system is mounted in single-user mode.

![bin.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/bin.png)

* There must be no subdirectories in `/bin`
* Commands used by all the users are located here (eg. chmod, cp, bash, ls)
* Applications such as Firefox are stored in `/usr/bin`
* A similar directory, `/sbin` contains essential system administration binaries (eg iptables, ifconfig, fdisk, reboot)



#### 2. /boot : static boot files:

It contains boot loader related files like GRUB files and Linux kernels i.e. data that is used before the kernel begins executing user-mode programs. The boot loader's configuration files are located in `/etc` which stores configuration files which we shall see further.

![boot.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/boot.png)

* kernel files: initrd.img-*
* grub files: inside grub folder
* vmlinux: vmlinuz-*



#### 3. /cdrom : historical mount point for CD-ROMs:

It isn't part of FHS standard, yet finds its way into Ubuntu and other distributions. It is a temporary location for CD-ROMs inserted in the system.
Standard location for *all* temporary media is in `/media` directory.



#### 4. /dev : device files:

This directory is the location of device files which include terminal devices, usb or any connected device. eg. /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0

![dev.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/dev.png)



#### 5. /etc : configuration files:

“Editable Text Configuration” or “Extended Tool Chest”.
A "configuration file" is a local file used to control the operation of a program; it must be static and cannot be an executable binary. It also contains startup and shutdown files for individual programs. eg. etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf

![etc.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/etc.png)



#### 6. /home : user home directories:

It stores the personal files(eg files stored on Desktop, in Downloads, Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos etc directories) of a user.



#### 7. /lib :

It hosts the essential shared libraries and kernel modules needed to boot the system and run commands i.e libraries essential for the binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`. Libraries needed by binaries of `/usr/bin` are located in `/usr/lib`.

![lib.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/lib.png)



#### 8. /lost+found : recovered files:

This directory is responsible for the recovery of lost data when a system crashes. When the system is rebooted after a crash a system check(fsck) is performed and corrupted files are placed in this directory.

![lost.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/lost.png)



#### 9. /media : mount point for removable media:

It contains subdirectories which are used as mount points for removable media such as zip drive



#### 10. /mnt : mount point for temporarily mounted filesystems:

Temporarily mounted file systems eg. a Windows partition can be used to perform some file recover operations. They are mounted as `/mnt/windows`.



#### 11. /opt : optional software packages:

Software packages like `lampp package`, `sublime text` are installed in '/opt'. The software packages in this directory are commonly proprietary software that dont follow the `FHS`.

![opt.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/opt.png)



#### 12. /proc : process information:

It conatins information about system processes. A seudo filesystem, it contains information about running processes .eg. `/proc/{pid}` contains information about the processes of that particular pid. It is a virtual filesystem providing system resources and kernel information as text files .eg. `/proc/uptime`.

![proc.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/proc.png)



#### 13. /root : root home directory:

It is the home directory for root user. This may be determined by developer or local preference. *You can view the contents of this directory using `sudo nautilus`*

![root.root.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/root.root.png)



#### 14. /sbin : system binaries:

Utilities used for system administration are stored in `/sbin`, `/usr/sbin` and `/usr/local/sbin`. These directories store essential binaries for booting, restoring, recovering and/or repairing the system in addition to binaries in `/bin`. eg. init, ip, mount, fsck

![sbin.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/sbin.png)



#### 15. /srv : service data:

It contains site-specific data which are served by the system. eg. if you are using the Apache HTTP server to serve a website, you'd likely store your website's files in a directory inside the /srv directory.


#### 16. /tmp : temporary files:

This directory is made available for programs that require storage of temporary files. These files are not preserved after a program goes out of scope. They can be deleted at any time by utilities such as `tmpwatch`.

![tmp.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/tmp.png)



#### 17. /usr : user binaries and read only data:

It contains sharable, read-only data used by the user (not the system). These include binaries, libraries, documentation and source-code for second level programs.

* `/usr/bin` contains binary files for user programs.
* `/usr/sbin` contains binary files for system administrators.
* `/usr/lib` contains libraries for `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`
* `/usr/local` contains use programs that are installed from source
* `/usr/share` contains architecture-independent files like graphics

![usr.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/usr.png "usr.png")



#### 18. /var :files:

It contains variable data files which include spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files.

`/var` makes it possible to mount `/usr` in read-only. In this mode, everything that once went into `/usr` that is written to during system operation must be in `/var`. eg. in read-only mode log files go to `/var/log`.

![var.png](https://github.com/salonirk11/blog/blob/master/images/FHS/var.png)
